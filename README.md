# UpcomingMovies

The UpcomingMovies is a simple application displaying the upcoming movies, using [themoviedb API](https://www.themoviedb.org). 
- Images are downloaded asynchronously in the background using GCD.
- The content is fetched on demand while the user scrolls
- A collection view was used to display the movie list
- While downloading each image asynchronously an activity indicator is presented


### The images represent the movie list and the movie details screen
